### Description
The Computer Science Department at CCNY gets  a cleaning too infrequently, leaving the offices in a bit of mess. The department heads were looking for a possible solution where the offices could be cleaned at any time with a scheduled “appointment”. The basic scheme that the department needs is a platform that people can use to schedule a cleaning for their office and be worry free. The solution that we came up with was making a smart cleaner that cleans a room based on a schedule that is updated in a web application. This smart cleaner will use Arduino to navigate through rooms and communicate with the web app using BT beacons.
